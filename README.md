# Rela-Nivo in Metastatic Melanoma

## Overview 
This is a repository for code to reproduce the figures from Cillo et al describing rela-nivo treatment in metastatic melanoma (under revision). 

## Reproducibility
We performed analyses in a Dockerized RStudio environment. The Dockerfile is available in this repository. 

We have also used the [renv package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) to track package versions that were used for analysis. These files are also available in this repositry under the r_environment directory. Please refer to the [renv package tutorial](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) for more information on using renv. 

## Downloading data
The data necessary to recreate the figures are available from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/uploads/10223746). While the manuscript is in revision, the data are available as password-protected zip files. These files will be publicly available upon acceptance. These data should be downloading and unzipped to be read into R as per R Markdown Files in the R directory.
